# PROJECT: BARS
## Description
Project Barley is the This project combines drones with the capabilities that GPS has to offer. In particular, the project is an autonomous, self-navigating drone using multiple sensors to reach a coordinate and return back home, all with one goal: to deliver a package. This project is a culmination of the resources currently available to autonomous vehicle designing on the internet, and companies like Zipline. 

## The way it works is simple:
User packs a package in its fuselage, utilizing a disposable parachute to slow it’s decent to target coordinates
User uploads target coordinates
Drone is sent off, calculating a simple route towards the coordinates
After coordinates are reached, it’s hatches below open and perform a 180 clockwise fight reroute back home
Drone is caught with a net for simplicity sake
## Why I built it
* Project has been halted for a whole year
I started designing this project a year ago, but then I stopped because I was too focused on rocketry. I am focusing on this project again now because it has a lot of potential for real-world applications. 
* This tech is not very available around the world
Zipline is my biggest inspiration, but they have limited hubs. I’d like to simplify this technology a ton so that implementation of this drone in other countries is less of a burden. 
* I think aerospace is cool
Everything aerospace related is super interesting to me, and although I switched my major from aerospace engineering to chemistry, I still super like the industry’s challenges and what they strive to solve. This is a main reason why I do rocketry and is trying to expand on my experiences on the field.
