Started part outsourcing: I started looking at the parts needed, but got only the main ones down (aka ESP32-WROOM, accelerometer + barometer + magnometer, etc) planning to continue the GPS/autonomous parts selection of this project some future date. These are the main components I usually use for my rocketry projects.

First instances of modeling, started with the ribs of the frame for the drone. Iâ€™ve decided to allocate a lot of space in Teh fuselage to fit packages 6 inches X 6 inches, and while this might not be a lot of space, it still contains the basic potential concept of delivering packages
